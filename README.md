# MATES
A Deep Learning-Based Model for Quantifying Transposable Elements in Single-Cell Sequencing Data

The raw fastq files are aligned using STAR-Solo for 10X scRNA-seq / scATAC-seq Data and STAR for Smart-Seq2 scRNA-seq Data to reserve multimapping reads. 

A sample alignment command line for 10X scRNA Data is:
```sh

```
A sample alignment command line for Smaert-seq2 scRNA Data is:
```sh

```
A sample alignment command line for 10X scATAC Data is:
```sh

```
The filtered cell barcodes file provide by STAR-Solo will be at STAR_Solo/sample_name/sample_name.out/Gene/filtered/barcodes.tsv, if you have your own filtered barcodes file, you can simply replace it at the same location.
