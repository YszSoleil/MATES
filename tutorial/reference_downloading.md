To download gene and TE (Transposable Element) references for your preferred species from the UCSC Genome Browser, follow these steps:

1. Go to the UCSC Genome Browser website: [https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway).

2. In the search bar, type the name of your preferred species and select it from the search results.

3. Once you've selected your species, click on **Tools** in the upper tab.

4. From the dropdown menu, choose **Table Browser**.

5. You will be directed to the Table Browser. This step initializes the **clade** and **genome** fields for your selected species.

6. Now, follow these steps for Gene Reference:

   - In the **clade** dropdown menu, ensure the clade is set to the appropriate classification.
   - In the **genome** dropdown menu, select the genome assembly you want to use.
   - The remaining fields can be set to their default values unless you have specific requirements.

   - Click the **get output** button.

7. For TE (Transposable Element) Reference:

   - Follow the same procedure as for the Gene Reference to initialize the **clade** and **genome** fields.

   - Change the remaining fields as shown below, making sure they match what you used for the Gene Reference unless you have special requirements.

   - Click the **get output** button.

8. After clicking the **get output** button for either the Gene Reference or TE Reference, the respective reference data will be processed, and you will be prompted to download the zipped reference file.

Follow these steps for both the Gene and TE References to obtain the required reference files for your preferred species.
